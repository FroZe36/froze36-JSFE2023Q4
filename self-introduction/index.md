Hello, I'm very glad that you are watching this video, in which I will tell you a bit about myself, my interests, hobbies, and my strong desire to learn about technologies.

My name is Danila, I'm 28 years old, I live in Minsk, and I'm a Front-end developer.
I have a higher education degree in Marketing and Economics. Currently, I am studying at the Rolling Scopes School. In my free time from studying and work, I play soccer, go running, swim in the pool, read books, learn English, enjoy spending time with friends, and love to eat delicious food.

Now, a little about my personal qualities:
I am disciplined, responsible, have good communication skills, love working in a team, and especially enjoy leading in that team.

My IT immersion began 2 years ago when I realized at my previous job that I wanted to change my field of work. I enrolled in paid Front-end developer courses without any prior knowledge in this field, only based on stories from friends in IT and attending a seminar to get into IT :).
During my studies, I had immense interest and a desire to understand everything. Upon completing the courses, I decided to quit my job and fully immerse myself in this field, focusing on what brings me pleasure!
I had acquired a lot of knowledge, but I wondered what to do with it and how to structure it?
I decided to try doing something myself, take on tasks from the internet, take a part in free marathons, watch YouTube videos. I stumbled upon a Telegram channel announcing the upcoming zero stage of RS School, I registered, and that's when my complete immersion into the Front-End developer profession began.
After successfully completing zero stage, I moved on to first stage and now preparing for second stage, hoping for its successful completion.
Thanks to RS School, I gained practical experience in implementing various tasks and gained a deeper understanding of how things work.

In addition to studying at RS School, I also successfully completed a project to create a website for a Clinic, where I used a new stack of technologies for me (Next.js (SSR), WordPress, Apollo).

In conclusion, I would like to talk about the goals and motivations I pursue.

Build a career as a sought-after developer.
Get into BigTech.
Take a part in a hackathon.
Thank you for watching!
Bye!
